## The Problem of Delay in Account Opening Time in Retail Banking
Bank of XYZ, a major bank receives on an average 2000 new saving account opening customer application forms every day. 40 operators enter the application forms in a database after cross checking the CAF (Customer Application Form) with Identity Proof details.  
The entries are rechecked against the Identity Proof details by 15 Quality Assessors and further 5% sample is audited by 3 Quality Supervisors. The sales team promises the account opening within 48 hours from receipt of the CAF. Bank of XYZ usually achieves the account opening within average of 30 hours with a standard deviation of 6 hrs.  
Recently, after a significant marketing effort, they started receiving over 3500 CAF, and the % of defects in the CAF increased far more than the acceptable 10% of total opportunities for error and processing time of CAF also increased, leading to account opening taking more than target of 48hrs.
### The Customer Application has the following sections (Opportunities for Error): 
1.	Title and Gender of the customer 
2.	Name of the customer 
3.	Address of the customer 
4.	Date 
5.	Identity Proof No 
6.	Product Code 
7.	Email Address 
<br> Any incorrect section is considered a defect and must be re-processed, resulting in high TAT.
The Bank is losing $3750 every day primarily on rework and penalties. The customers are also dissatisfied as the account opening is taking more time than promised. In the wake of the current business situation, the management team decides to initiate a Six Sigma project to reduce defects and achieve target account opening time.
<br>
1.	How can data be used to identify the root causes of the increased defects in the Customer Application Form (CAF) that contribute to errors in account opening processes?
2.	Using the Six Sigma approach, what can be implemented to streamline the account opening process and handle increased volumes efficiently, ensuring that the target of opening accounts within 48 hours is consistently met?
3.	Develop a strategic plan to reduce operational costs while maintaining or improving overall efficiency and productivity?
The PPT should have maximum 5 slides (excluding introduction)
