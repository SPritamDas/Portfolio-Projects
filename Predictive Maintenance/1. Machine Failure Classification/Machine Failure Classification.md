## Overview
This project aims to predict machine failures using a synthetic dataset that reflects real-world scenarios in predictive maintenance. It includes both binary classification to determine whether a machine has failed and multiclass classification to identify the type of failure.

---

## Dataset
The **Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification Dataset** consists of **10,000 data points** with **14 features**. This dataset simulates predictive maintenance situations commonly encountered in the industry.

### Dataset Features
| Feature                  | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **UID**                  | Unique identifier ranging from 1 to 10,000               |
| **ProductID**            | Quality variants (L: Low, M: Medium, H: High)            |
| **Air Temperature [K]**  | Generated with a random walk process (Ïƒ = 2 K)           |
| **Process Temperature [K]** | Generated with a random walk process + 10 K (Ïƒ = 1 K) |
| **Rotational Speed [rpm]** | Calculated from 2860 W power with noise                |
| **Torque [Nm]**         | Normally distributed around 40 Nm (Ïƒ = 10 Nm)             |
| **Tool Wear [min]**     | Varies by quality variant (H/M/L: +5/3/2 minutes)         |
| **Target**               | Indicates machine failure (binary)                        |
| **Failure Type**         | Type of failure (multiclass)                             |

### Target Variables
**Important:** There are two targets. Avoid using either as features to prevent data leakage:
- **Target:** Failure or Not
- **Failure Type:** Type of Failure

| Target Variable       | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Failure**           | 1 (Failed), 0 (Not Failed)                  |
| **Failure Type**      | Categories include Heat Dissipation, etc.   |
