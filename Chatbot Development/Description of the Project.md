# **Generative AI Chatbot for PDF Information Retrieval**

## **Description**
This project features a Generative AI-powered chatbot designed for efficient information retrieval from large PDF documents. Utilizing **Gemini API** for generative responses and **Pinecone API** for vector-based search, the chatbot processes 300+ page PDFs by dividing each page into three chunks. This approach ensures enhanced data granularity, improved prediction accuracy, and faster query responses.

## **Features**
- **Granular Data Chunking**: Each PDF page is divided into three chunks, optimizing data representation and improving retrieval precision.
- **Vector-Based Search**: Integrated **Pinecone API** for fast and efficient indexing of PDF content.
- **Generative AI Responses**: Utilized **Gemini API** with a temperature of 0.3 for consistent and context-aware predictions.
- **Flask Backend**: Developed a Flask-based backend to manage API integration and user interaction seamlessly.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & APIs**: Flask, Gemini API, Pinecone API, pdfplumber
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
